            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But in this myſticall body it is farre otherwayes: For here euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to bee a Merchant, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.13. ſeeing euery Chriſtian man hath receiued ſome <hi>talents</hi> of his Lord to trafficke with; &amp; charge alſo to trade, and occupie with them till hee come: And whereas in ciuill dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Miniſters are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and prohibited, that they muſt neither make merchandiſe of the word, nor intangle

                  <p>So much for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude betweene them:<note place="margin">The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween earthly and heauenly trading ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in fiue things.</note> Now the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and reaſon of this reſemblance ſtandeth in fiue things.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5622:41"/>ſecular riches and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: A worldly rich man is rich for himſelfe only, and the more he imparteth to others, the leſſe is leſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; But hee that is rich in God, is not only rich in &amp; for himſelfe; but theſe riches doe more inrich him by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching others, than holding them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and the more he communicateth, the more remaineth; as the oyle in the cruſe and the meale in the barrell, were not waſted with ſpending, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:5622:42"/>

The Merchant refuſeth no paines or perill, no labour or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, no coſt or charge, no hazard by Sea or Land to purchaſe ſuch commodities, as may yeeld him returne of profit and aduantage: But eſpecially Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Merchants for Pearls, toile themſelues by many weary iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and voyages, into all lands and countries; and haue their factors
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5622:42"/>lying abroad euery where to meet with Pearles and precious ſtones which are of greateſt gaine and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</p>
                  <p>So the Chriſtian Merchant hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable thirſt and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after the good things of the Goſpell; and with vnweariable ſtudy and deſire he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelleth to euery Mart, where this Pearle may be met withall: he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, frequenteth euery Sermon, <hi>waiteth at the gates of Wiſdome:</hi>

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:5622:43"/>hee ſwalloweth eaſily matter of labour and charge, to become ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Pearle, and hee is inſtant in this painfull endeuour: for here it is not as in ciuill trading, wherein many Merchants hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten money enough, giue vp their trade, and take their eaſe in the Country: but ſo long as there is any good comming in, he will be ready for it: and as the labour of the body bringeth thirſt, ſo the labour of the ſoule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth thirſt after
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:5622:43"/>grace. Beſides that, grace is ſo ſweet to a godly heart, as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Merchant can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee ſatisfied, nor euer giue vp as hauing enough; and as hee knoweth the ſtreame from whence hee ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, can neuer bee drawne drie: ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is euer in want of ſome good things, or at the leaſt of ſome meaſure of it; and is euer ſeeking the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">5. They agree in care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their eſtate.</note> they agree in the care of preſeruing, and ſafe keeping the

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:5622:44"/>
                  <p>So the Chriſtian Merchants are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall chaſe and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit by Satan, ſeducers, heretickes, falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, tyrants, and all prophane ones in the world; Beſides their owne inbred rebellion and lufts, which fight againſt their owne ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Now then all theſe lie in wait ſo much more diligently, as the wealth is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than any other, to rob theſe Merchants, not of ſiluer or gold, but of faith and hope,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5622:45"/>and all their graces, the leaſt of which is much more precious than gold, or the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pearles that euer lay hid in the bowels of the earth: Yea them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are ſo furiouſly aſſaulted, as hardly they may eſcape with goods or life, as wee may ſee in Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, who for his ſake were bereaued, and ſtripped of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts of life, and life it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Hence the wiſe Chriſtian Merchant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5622:45"/>carefully fenceth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with Gods feare: Secondly, ſtandeth on his ground and guard of faith: Thirdly, loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp his graces and the word in his heart: Fourthly, keepeth wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with God mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening in holy praier and praiſes: Fiftly, with Chriſtian fortitude and armour, hee maintaineth the meaſure of grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: By all which meanes hee not onely diſappointeth the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of his prey, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſheweth his owne

                  <p>Secondly, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant will not lay out his money but for a hopefull bargaine. <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.2. <hi>Wherefore doe you lay out ſiluer and not for bread, and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

                  <p>So a wiſe Chriſtian Merchant will ſpend his time and labour on that, which when hee hath gotten, will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him; which if hee beſtow in outward things, (ſuppoſe hee

                  <p>Thirdly, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant will often caſt his eſtate, his bookes, his ſhops, and his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ſtocke increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:5622:88"/>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voluntary pouerty: and hold it a counſell onely fit for perfect Chriſtians, and farre more meritorious than the keeping of the whole Law.</p>
                  <p>But 1. to anſwer them, and then the queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a friuolous conceit to thinke, that any man may come to an higher eſtate of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, by ſome other meanes than by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to thinke that any worke can be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly done toward ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:5622:89"/>which is without the walke and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the law, which is ſo perfect, that curſed is he that doth dare to adde to it, or detract any thing from it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt deſired no more of the young man, than he did of his Diſciples, who ſaid verſe 27. wee haue <hi>left all to follow thee,</hi> and yet <hi>Peter</hi> had an houſe ſtill, and <hi>Iohn,</hi> to which hee tooke the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore Chriſt would haue the young man to part with all, which hee could not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:5622:89"/>hold with his loue and affection to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that which Chriſt required of this <hi>Iuſtitiarie,</hi> is not any deuiſed Euangelicall counſel aboue the law; but a dutie contained in the law: the ſumme of which is, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart:</hi> and whereas hee had boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, that hee had kept all the law; Chriſt doth ſend him backe againe to the law, to let him ſee his want of loue, both to God and his
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:5622:90"/>neighbour; to God, if the loue of his friends hinder him from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, whom he confeſſeth a teacher from God: And want of loue to man, if at Chriſts word hee will not part with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, eſpecially if not at Chriſt his eſpeciall commandement.</p>
                  <p>So as this is not a counſell to ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect recluſes or orders of wilfull men; but a commandement to all Chriſtians, that muſt ſtriue to perfection. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. And we ſpeak
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:5622:90"/>wiſdom amongſt them <hi>that are perfect:</hi> who muſt not onely leaue goods and lands, and houſes for Chriſt, and the Goſpell; but muſt hate father, mother, wife, and children, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſiſters, and their owne life, if they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not hold them with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>So much to anſwer the Papiſts:</p>
                  <p>Now to the queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who can denie wealth to be the gift of God, if it be held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out couetouſnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, pride, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to heauen and

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:5622:91"/>we muſt abandon all we haue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when they proue an impediment to our calling, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſion, we muſt renounce them,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.25.</note> as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in this caſe refuſed to be the ſonne of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> daughter, and to ſuffer with Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: a traueller may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie a ſtaffe to helpe him in his iourney, but not to ouer-load himſelfe: and he may beare ſome money in his purſe for his charges, but not burthen himſelfe with it.</p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:5622:92"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, in <hi>affection</hi> alwaies wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them, and hold them retiredly and weignedly, <hi>vſing the world as not vſing it:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.3.</note>Let them be in our hands, not in our hearts; to lay downe, or lay out; not to lay vp, or lay vp our hearts with them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And buyeth it.]</hi> Our ſauiour vſeth this word <hi>buying,</hi> not to ſignifie, that we can make any recompence, payment, or merit, to purchaſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life: for, firſt, that is infinite, we finite, and betweene theſe is no proportion. Secondly, it is a free gift of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. Thirdly, it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:5622:93"/>is a buying,<note place="margin">Eſay 55.1.</note> but <hi>without money,</hi> &amp; money worth. And <hi>the poore</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to buy it, who haue no money to lay out for it. Fourthly, this Pearle is ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, as neither men nor Angels can giue any due price for. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we can giue God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his owne.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth figuratiuely, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this wiſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant dealeth as a buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;<note place="margin">The Chriſtian man reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth a buyer in 4. things.</note>firſt, hee ſeeth the want of Gods grace &amp; Chriſts merits; the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty are called to buy, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1.</p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:5622:93"/>
                  <p>Secondly, as a buyer, he <hi>priſeth,</hi> valueth, and caſteth the worth; eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Chriſt at the hieſt rate, and all things elſe in compariſon of him, loſſe, and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as a buyer he maketh an exchange; not of money, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney worth, but vſeth all good indeuour, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by prayer, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and the vſe of all good meanes, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the grace of the Goſpell.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, made, is earneſted; ſo the beleeuer, able to giue nothing to God, taketh from God the earneſt of his Spirit, in ſome ſauing graces; by which the whole bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of eternall life is

                  <p>Secondly, the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an knoweth that hee ſhall bee no loſer by the bargaine; other Mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts buying great commodities know
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:5622:96"/>not whether they ſhall be gainers or no: and many ſeeke Pearles with infinite loſſes and finde them not: But here is a certaine and an vndoubted gaine, for whoſoeuer forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth houſe, wife, lands, liberty, children, and life for Chriſts ſake, and the Goſpell, ſhall receiue <hi>an hundred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in this life with tribulation, and in the world to come life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting:</hi> here is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enough, not ten in the hundred, but an hundred for tenne:

                  <p>Thirdly, this putteth a difference betweene ſoundneſſe and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; the hypocrite can ſell much for Gods fauour. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.6. they will giue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of rammes, and ten thouſand of riuers of oyle: and their firſt borne, but will not part with their ſinnes. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> can part with three parts of their portion: but ſoundneſſe eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe it ſeeth Chriſt forſaking all, liberty, life, wealth, heauen, and happineſſe for it; in the way of thankfulneſſe, grace in the heart doth hold it ſelfe bound to forſake all for Chriſt.</p>

For ſuch is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:5622:119"/>the wiſdome of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that hee can draw ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſweet, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble concluſions from thoſe principles and grounds, from which fleſh and corruption vſeth to ſucke ſinne and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and teacheth the Saints ſo to doe.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, in their owne account and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they are ſtrangers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>All</hi> theſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:5622:126"/>that they were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and pilgrimes vpon earth.</hi> And in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the world alſo they are ſtrangers, which vſeth them ſtrangely and courſely, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was a ſtranger to his brethren <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.8.

Secondly, as a Tabernacle is a moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tent, pitched for a day; ouer-night is ſet vp, and perhaps, the next day the ſtakes are pulled vp, and the cordes are ſlacked, and the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                  <p>Thirdly, as a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle is onely a couering but hath no foundation to ſettle vpon: ſo <hi>Iob</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of our bodies, as houſes <hi>of clay,</hi>

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:5622:128"/>
                  <p>Fouthly, the godly are ſtrangers heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in reſpect of their buſineſſe, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a ſtranger is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the place where hee takes vp his Inne, hee meddles not with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, the offices, the paſſages of cauſes in the towne where hee lieth as a ſtranger; but intendeth his iourney, and onely careth how hee may paſſe through: and if hee haue any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe there, it is onely to aduance his eſtate at home in his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5622:129"/>And ſo it is with the godly; they eſtrange themſelues as much as may bee from the world, and the common cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it: their callings they caſt not off, becauſe they are commaunded to abide in them with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate care, to prouide for themſelues, and theirs. And for earthly things they cannot bee without them, while they haue a life to maintaine by them; but yet they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle no more with them than needes muſt; and in the middeſt of their earthly buſineſſe are not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5622:129"/>earthly minded. They are Burgeſſes of another Corporation,<note place="margin">Col. 3.10.</note> and all their trading and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique heere is to make themſelues a rich and ſure eſtate there. They haue a chiefe buſineſſe to doe, which they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intend, namely, to ſeeke the kingdome of God, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of it; to repent of their ſinnes, to beleeue in the Sonne of God; and to make their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure: whereto they giue all diligeuce, as they are exhorted 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:5622:130"/>
                  <p>Fiftly, The godly are ſtrangers in reſpect of their affection; for, as ſtrangers long after home; and where euer their bodies bee, their hearts and mindes are not there, but at home where their deare friends and eſtates are: So is it with the Saints, whoſe mindes and meditations, and conuerſation are in heauen before hand; for there is their Fathers houſe, and there is their inheritance; there is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt their treaſure; and no maruell if their hearts bee there where
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:5622:130"/>their treaſure is. The worldling hath his whole portion in this life, and therefore hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes all his heart, his thoughts, his cares, his deſires, and endeauours vpon the world; he runs after it with a full deſire. But it cannot bee ſo with the godly man, who is minded as was good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> 2.3. Who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his perſon was in the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> his Court, and was a neere attendant at the Kings Table, yet his heart was at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> who while hee was

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But are not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men ſtrangers heere vpon earth, as well as the godly?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wicked men and worldlings are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtrangers here, if we looke towards God, they are ſtrangers with him, ſtrangers from the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God; and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the life, and wayes of God. Or if we conſider the time of their continuance heere, they haue no more continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5622:131"/>heere, than others; they haue no Leaſes of their liues; nor no ſurer hold of their eſtates than others haue. The rich Glutton heard; <hi>Thou foole this night ſhall they take away thy ſoule,</hi> and all. Or if wee conſider the place in which they liue, they are ſtrangers; for the Eaſt wind takes away and hurles them out of their place,<note place="margin">Iob 27.21.</note> as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as any other.

                  <p>But wicked men are not ſtrangers as the godly are, in foure reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or conceit; for, though their eſtate bee as vnſtable as any others; yet haue they a ſtrong conceit of continuance, and of taking their reſt for many yeeres. They are deſcribed to bee ſuch as put off the euill day; and make leagues with death; and are hardly brought to confeſſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5622:132"/>themſelues to be Pilgrims and ſtrangers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the worlds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they bee not ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but neighbours, and Towne-dwellers.

                  <p>Secondly, In that wee are ſtrangers heere, wee learne another Dutic, which is, the exerciſe of Chriſtian patience and contentment in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, be it ſickneſſe, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, reproaches, abuſes or wrongs in any kinde: a ſtranger is contented to endure the wrongs that meet him in his way; hee digeſteth, and putteth vp all patiently; he complaineth not, and much leſſe ſeeketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: for hee knowes he ſhall haue little reſt or redreſſe till hee come home: Euen ſo the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5622:137"/>
                     <hi>Pilgrim</hi> muſt learne patiently to endure the afflictions, and courſe and croſſe vſages of this ſtrange Country, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. laſt verſe, the bleſſed Apoſtle was contented to endure all indignities and wrongs; becauſe hee was of another countrey, the high priuiledges and excellencies whereof, <hi>Eie hath neuer ſeene,</hi> nor <hi>eare hath ever heard,</hi> nor <hi>ever entred into the heart of man.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>A ſtranger turnes not againſt euery Dogge that barketh at him; let <hi>Doeg</hi> accuſe, and <hi>Shemei</hi> reuile, let Currs barke, there is no hope to ſtill them; the beſt way is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them, and attend and ride on thy way. A ſtranger ſhrinkes not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:5622:139"/>for euery ſhower of raine, nor is diſheartned with the roughneſſe,<note place="margin">Nubecula eſt, tranſilis.</note> and foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the way; but hee will through thicke and thinne, through drops and drought, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is going home. Neither muſt thou that art a Chriſtian Pilgrim, ſhrinke for the ſtormes of the world, nor the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſneſſe of the way, which is all ſtrewed with croſſes; but hearten thy ſelfe as the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger who vſually ſayth, it is neuer an ill day that hath a good night; and though many bitter pils
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:5622:139"/>of harſh and ſtrange vſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges muſt bee ſwallowed by theſe ſtrangers, yet the conſideration of home is as ſugar in their pockets to ſweeten them all.</p>
                  <p>A ſtranger meaſures not his owne worth, nor thinketh worſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for things befalling him in the way; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeth and valueth himſelfe, according to his eſtate at home: So muſt the Chriſtian ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, liue by faith, looke vpon things not ſeene. Let the world vnder-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thee, content thy

                  <p>Thirdly, a third du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hence that wee are ſtrangers heere, is to learne to eſtrange our ſelues from the world, and courſes of worldly men. A ſtranger when euer hee trauailes, retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the manners, faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cuſtomes of his owne countrey; a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſtranger although hee

Shall I (ſaith <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>) commit this ſinne againſt my God, againſt my Maſter? Seeing my Maſter hath kept no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from mee but ſinne; I will not doe this thing, I will not ſinne, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this high wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A fourth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:5622:142"/>is, that ſeeing we are ſtrangers heere, to learne to affect our owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and highly to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it. Euery man by nature loueth his natiue Countrey beſt; neither thinketh himſelfe ſo well in any forreine land; and ſtrangers, eſpecially hauing parents, kindred, and great reuenues in their natiue ſoyle; and being hardly entreated where they ſoiourne; would be glad to returne home, and enioy the ſight of thoſe whom they haue long longed to ſee: Euen ſo the Chriſtian
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:5622:143"/>Pilgrim. Neuer did <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> more affect and extoll their owne Countrey in their baniſhment from it, and captiuitie in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> than the Chriſtian ſtranger doth affectedly deſire, and preferre his heauenly Countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue this ſtrange land, the Countrey of his captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; For, hee diſcerneth that this is not his Countrey, firſt, That is a mans Country where he was borne and brought vp, but whence taketh a Chriſtian his ſpirituall birth, or where is hee brought vp but in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:5622:143"/>Church and kingdome of Chriſt? Earth giueth him a birth and being as hee is man, but as a Chriſtian hee is borne of God. Secondly, againe, that is a mans countrey where his parents, his anceſtors, and deare kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dwell, and inhabit. Now where dwelleth the Chriſtian mans Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in heauen? Where is his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but there? Where are all his brethren and ſiſters, ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſame parents but there? and therefore heauen is his Countrey.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:5622:144"/>Thirdly, Further, that is a mans Countrey where his principall eſtate, and goods are, where his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony and inheritance lyeth; and where is the chiefe portion, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the immortall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but in heauen? And where elſe is his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie? Now then, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conſidering on the one hand, that hee is in a ſtrange Countrey, and how hardly hee hath bin intreated in it, and ſo likely to be ſtill; and on the other hand, that hee hath an home and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5622:144"/>there that loueth him dearely; and that his elder brother Ieſus Chriſt, and all his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kindred, the Saints of God are there; And beſides that, hee hath a rich portion and a large patrimony, euen an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall inheritance in heauen; how can hee chuſe but to bee reared in his affections, yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed to bee there? de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring nothing in the world more than to <hi>bee diſſolued</hi> hence, and to <hi>bee with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> A Traueller hath his minde, and thoughts

So is it with the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Paſſenger, his minde is not where his body is; and if hee cannot get home in the body as ſoone as hee deſireth, yet in his ſpirit, hee will minde heauen, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things; hee will get as neere home as hee can; if he cannot get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of the citie,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5622:145"/>hee will bee ſure to get into the ſuburbes, the Church of God. If hee cannot get ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>Ieruſalem which is aboue,</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> A traueller fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe to his iourney two waies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By caſting off, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5622:151"/>leauing behinde him whatſoeuer would bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or hinder him in his way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By prouiding for himſelfe things fit for his iourney.</p>
                  <p>Of the former ſort there be three eſpeciall encumbrances that the Chriſtian Pilgrim muſt lighten himſelfe off. The firſt of them is ſinne, which as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable burden <hi>preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs downe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> and <hi>han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth faſt on;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth <hi>to caſt it off,</hi> if wee meane to runne
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5622:152"/>the race before vs. Now the way to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our ſelues of this weight, is to exerciſe euery day the grace of repentance and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and daily to take ſome ſinne or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hand, and at leaſt to ſlake and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the power of it, that if wee cannot bee rid of the ſinne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the preſence of it, yet we may be rid of the reigne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, are earthly cares, profits, and pleaſures, which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5622:152"/>are as heauy ſtones tyed vnto vs, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vs from heauen to earth, making heauie and ſad the ſoule, and vnweildy in her moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The way for vs to lighten our ſelues of theſe encumbrances, is daily and continually to eleuate, and raiſe our thoughts homeward, and heauenward, and exerciſe our ſelues in holy meditations, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and praiſes, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times through the day.</p>
                  <p>For as he that would keepe a Clocke in true
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5622:153"/>motion, muſt euery day ſundry times winde vp the plummets, which are ſtil drawing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; euen ſo muſt we doe with our hearts; the cares and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world are as plummets of Lead, preſſing downe the ſoule inceſſantly, in her motion towards heauen; and hee that would continue his motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt daily wind vp his heart towards God: and by maine ſtrength of grace fetch it vp from earth, that it may be ſirmly ſetled on
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:5622:153"/>heauenly things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting it ſelfe with the riches of heauen; &amp; with contemplation of thoſe pleaſures, that are at the right hand of God for euermore.</p>
                  <p>The third encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, is the feare of death, which preſſeth vs all our life; and the Chriſtian muſt lighten himſelfe of this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by looking beyond it to his own home; by longing after the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, whom none can ſee in the body and liue; by conſidering that the nearer he is to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5622:154"/>death, hee is ſo much neerer home. And what ſtranger feareth to goe home; or is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry when after a long abſence, hee is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into his owne Citie?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A wiſe Chriſtian will furniſh and prouide himſelfe with neceſſaries, and needefull ſupplies, to helpe him through his iourney.</p>
                  <p>There be fiue things eſpecially which a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller muſt fit himſelfe withall, that his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney may bee leſſe tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5622:154"/>and more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The knowledge of the direct way. Now whereas no man knowes the way to the heauenly countrey, without Gods tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, euery one muſt goe to God himſelfe firſt, and then to ſuch as God hath appointed to bee the directors, and inſtructors in this way.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By conſtant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to Gods word; for God goeth before vs by his word, as hee did before <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:5622:160"/>Pillar of the Cloud &amp; fire, and willing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods word maketh God our guide.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A ſtranger in his way needeth his viance, or prouiſion for his expence. The word of God is the Chriſtians <hi>viaticum,</hi> &amp; ſupplyeth all his needs, it affoords him food in his hunger, being the bread of life, and the Mannah that came downe from heauen; it yeeldeth him drinke in his thirſt, being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thirſteth, is

                  <p>Fourthly, a traueller hath need of a weapon to defend himſelfe, and to wound or keepe off his enemies. The ſame word of God is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5622:161"/>armour; it is the ſword of the Spirit. And as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword, Oh, there is none to that, giue mee that; ſo there is no ſword to this for the repulſe of all ſpirituall enemies, and for the ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of him that ſhall buckle it cloſe vnto him. Beſides that, it directs him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and faſten vnto him all the other pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſtian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſo as in no part he lie open or naked to danger.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:5622:161"/>
                  <p>Fiftly, A Traueller hath neede of good company, which is <hi>pro vehiculo,</hi> as good as a Waggon or Coach, to carry him with the more eaſe through the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the way. The ſame teſtimonies of God are ſweete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and helpe to deceiue, and paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our time comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; if wee can <hi>talke of them in the way,</hi> and in the houſe, and in the field; and if wee can whet them vpon our ſelues and

                  <p>Now how happily ſhall this man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe his iourney,<note place="margin">Pſa. 119.54.</note> and goe <hi>ſinging</hi> through

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:5622:188"/>but I may ſay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in a maner more than a Conquerour by them; for, God (who bringeth light out of darkeneſſe) made theſe temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a ſweet ſeaſoning of her whole life. By occaſion of which, ſhee tied her ſelfe to a ſtrict courſe of godlineſſe, and a conſtant practiſe of Chriſtian Duties,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:5622:188"/>which ſhe religiouſly obſerned euen till her dying day.</p>
                  <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">Her reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life.</note> that ſhee might bee ſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the Truth, and confirmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe former wauerings and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſhee vowed, that God aſſiſting her, ſhee would euery yeere reade ouer the whole Bible in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe,<note place="margin">Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> which courſe ſhe conſtantly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:5622:189"/>obſerued for the ſpace of fifteene yeres together, beginning her taske vpon her birth day, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euery day ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chapters as to bring it about iuſt with the yeere. By which exerciſe ſhee gained a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of knowledge, and no leſſe ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of her faith; for ſhee did not reade careleſly or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:5622:189"/>but alwayes kept a note of what places ſhe did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and would ſtill be inquiring the meaning of them, as ſhee met either with Miniſters, or ſuch as ſhee thought were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to informe her in the ſame. And her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee opened her Bible, to ſend vp a ſhort prayer vnto god, for the opening of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:5622:190"/>her blinde eyes, to the vnderſtanding of thoſe ſacred myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that ſo they might bee as a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne to guide her feet in the wayes of holineſſe, vntill ſhee had attained her deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>And not here with contented, as a good <hi>Mary</hi> ſhee pondered the Word of God in her heart, for by her great induſtry in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:5622:190"/>Scriptures, ſhee had gotten by heart ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſelect Chapters, and ſpeciall <hi>Pſalmes;</hi> and of euery Booke of the Scripture one choife verſe: all which ſhee weekly repeated in an order which ſhee propounded to her ſelfe: and being asked why ſhee was ſo laborious in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and retaining thoſe Scriptures in memory? Her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:5622:191"/>was, that ſhee knew not what dayest of triall, or perſecution might come, wherein ſhee might bee depriued of her Bible, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good bookes and helpes; but ſo much of the Scriptures as ſhee could get into her heart, ſhee knew no Tyrants or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could bereaue or rob her of (God make thee that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:5622:191"/>and me that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this, ſo Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly prouident, as in theſe dayes of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to lay vp ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for the dayes of ſtraitneſſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.) Secondly,<note place="margin">Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in her priuat Prayers.</note>from that time of her trouble ſhee reſolued vpon <hi>Daniels</hi> practiſe, wherein ſhee was alſo conſtant; namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which were twiſe a day performed by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:5622:192"/>the Chaplin in that Religious houſe in which ſhee liued till within one yeere of her death; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the priuate Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crs that ſhee dayly read in her Ladies Bedchamber, ſhe was thrice euery day on her knees before God in ſecret, like a true worſhipper, whoſe delight was to bee in Gods preſence. By meanes of which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:5622:192"/>daily exerciſe, beſides all other comfortable fruits, ſhee attained a ſingular ſweet gift in prayer, whereby ſhee could both ſtrongly wreſtle, and happily preuaile with God, whoſe grace ſuffereth himſelfe to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his weake ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſhee knew that religious faſting is the whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:5622:193"/>of Prayer, ſhee tied her ſelfe to ſet apart ſix dayes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeere, wherein ſhe was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily humbled in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prayer, for her owne ſinnes, and the ſins of the times. At all which times ſhee was in ſpeciall manner earneſt with the Lord, that hee would bee pleaſed further to reueale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her his whole
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:5622:193"/>Truth, needfull for her ſaluation, and keepe her conſtant in the obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto the end.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſhee knew that the right and worthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments affordeth a Chriſtian ſpeciall ſtrength, and much ſtability in the courſe of godlineſſe: as ſhee diligently apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that comfort
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:5622:194"/>when ſhe could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently receiue that Sacrament; ſo for many yeeres ſhee had laid a band vpon her ſelfe, neuer to receiue it, but the day before to fit, and examine her ſelfe ſeriouſly, deeply humbling her ſelfe before the Lord in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prayer all the day long.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of her conſcience, made her euer of a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:5622:194"/>tender conſcience: fearefull ſhee was of offending God and her owne conſcience; and watched her ſelfe narrowly; and to keepe her ſelfe in awe; for the ſpace of fiue yeeres before her death, ſhe kept a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of her daily ſlips, and ſet downe euen the naughtie thoughts which ſhee obſerued in her ſelfe, that one day in euery
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:5622:195"/>weeke ſhe might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily humble her ſelfe for all the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of that weeke, and this with ſuch moderate abſtinence as might beſt fit her weake body to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and feruent praier. And all theſe priuate religious duties, ſhee performed ſo ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that none but her boſome friend knew of their performance. As ſhe was thus feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:5622:195"/>of ſinnes preſent, and to come, ſo her conſcience was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in reſpect of ſins paſt as may appeare by this memorable inſtance. Whileſt ſhee was a child bred vp in the chamber of that old Lady, ſhe was entiſed by lewd ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants who fed her with figs, and other ſuch toies, fit to pleaſe children withall, to ſteale money out of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:5622:196"/>the Ladies Cabinet which often ſtood open in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and which they knew ſhee had the fitteſt opportunitie to doe of all other: whereunto her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhneſſe giuing way, ſhee found it not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo continued it for ſeuen yeeres or thereabouts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great checke of Conſcience. But when the light of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:5622:196"/>God came in and made a priuy ſearch in the heart; and made her able to take her ſelfe with the fact; now ſhee was aſhamed and confounded in her ſelfe, and her ſtirred conſcience gaue her no reſt, nor could ſhee conceiue any hope of quiet, beeauſe ſheſaw, ſhe had done that which ſhe could no way vndoe. If ſhe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:5622:197"/>looked at the ſumme of money taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> conceiued that by continuing in that courſe ſeuen yeeres together, ſhee might haue wronged that Lady thirtie or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pound. If ſhee thought of reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſhee was no way able. Thus ſhee carried the burden of this ſin a long time, eaſing it aſwell as ſhee
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:5622:197"/>could with a reſolute purpoſe, if euer God pleaſed to make her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to make reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the heires of the deceaſed Lady. And accordingly ſo ſhee did. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Lady, whom ſhee ſo long ſerued, gaue her a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſhee forthwith made choice of a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:5622:198"/>Reuerend Miniſter, whom ſhee emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein (enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him ſecrecie) and becauſe ſhee would bee ſure to make full reſtitution, ſhe deliuered him ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds, to tender vnto this Ladies heire, as from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ſeruant of the Ladies, who had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly taken it away from her. And when the Gentleman retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:5622:198"/>ten pounds of it backe againe, ſuch was the tenderneſſe of her conſcience, that ſhee would receiue none of it to her own vſe; but gaue it away to poore and pious perſons and vſes. And this childiſh errour God turned to her good; for in all the two and twenty yeeres of her ſeruice vnto that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lady, ſhee neuer
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:5622:199"/>durſt make vſe of any thing that was vnder her charge, were it ſmall or great, but ſet it downe in writing, and once euery yeere did make it good, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the kinde, or in ſome other thing which ſhee bought for her Ladiſhips vſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> the ſenſe of her owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and wants made her of a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and charitable
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:5622:199"/>diſpoſition towards the wants, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of others. Shee had euer a large heart to the poore, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the godly poore; ſhe neuer did ſee or heare of any that were in want, but her heart did mourne if ſhee had not to releeue them, neither was her hand ſhut, for ſhee did yeerely lay aſide a portion of money
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:5622:200"/>to the vttermoſt of her ability (if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond) for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe. Thus ſhee liued holily, happily, and deſiredly: Neither could ſo gracious a life be ſhut vp but by an anſwerable, that is, an happy death and diſſolution, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will adde but a few wordes, and ſo leaue her to her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe till wee meet happily againe.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:5622:200"/>
                  <p>True it is,<note place="margin">Her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> that the life of a Chriſtian ſhould bee a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall meditation of death, as it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall motion to death: and ſuch was the latter part eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the life of this Chriſtian woman, who was of weake and ſickly conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her death, which made her ſo much the more prepared
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:5622:201"/>for her laſt combate and ſickneſſe, which laſted ten weekes; in all which time ſhee certainly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and expected her diſſolution, it being the principall, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt onely ſubiect of her diſcourſe, ſix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths before it came.

                     <p n="1">1. No ornament or faſhion may be vſed to offend our Chriſtian brother. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.21. It is not good to doe any thing (ſuppoſe it more neceſſary than attires) with offending the weake brother. If the heart ſuſpect or diſcerne, that this or that attire may or doe offend any Chriſtian; if the iuſt cauſe of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5622:227"/>offence riſe not out of the thing which may be allowable enough, but out of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that takes the offence, the precept of the Apoſtle bindeth it, to tender the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his brother, and now to forbeare his or her lawfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; and vpon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reaſon. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe charitie is better than outward orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2.

                     <p n="2">2. No ornament, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, habit, or faſhion, may bee vſed to the ſtrengthning of any vaine minds in their new-fangled &amp; ſtrange guiſes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. And

Now as it will be a ſorry plea for thy ſelfe in thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſay, I thought I might doe this or that, becauſe I ſaw ſome before me whom I thought well of; ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5622:229"/>will it iuſtly increaſe thy iudgement, that thou haſt by thy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe ſtrengthned the hands of ſinners, and hardned them in their ſinne, whom by thy ſober and ſeemely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage thou ſhouldeſt haue actually and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reproued. Yea and in that rule of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Let all things be done to edification,</hi> thou art caſt as guiltie, who haſt deſtroyed him by thy example, whom thou ſhouldeſt haue edified.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. No ornament or attire may bee vſed, which may become either a ſnare to our ſelues or others. There are ſome habits fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to draw eyes, to get louers, and to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion vnlawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.

                     <p n="4">IV. Now followes the laſt ranke of rules, concerning the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or attires them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. No outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament or habit may be vſed vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5622:231"/>which is ſeuered from the inward orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of grace vpon the ſoule. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles no where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this argument, but they commend this to the chiefe care of Chriſtian women, to bee more ſollicitous and curious in ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſoule with grace, than the body with gay clothing: and plainly teach that the true ornament of a Chriſtian woman is her ſanctification,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.3.</note>which beautifieth the hidden man before
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5622:231"/>God. This is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament for her head,<note place="margin">Prou. 1.9.</note>and chaines for her necke. This is the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of gold and ſtuds of ſiluer, which make her comely in the eye of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.10, 11. Yea this is her grace among men, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 31.25. <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>30</label> And when <hi>fauour ſhall proue deceitfull, and beautie to bee vanitie,</hi> then ſhall a woman fearing the Lord bee praiſed. All ornaments of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all artificiall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and couers are but filthineſſe, where
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5622:232"/>this is wanting. See <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 11.22. A iewell of gold in a ſwines ſnout, is a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull woman without inward comelineſſe. Seuer this from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ornament; and though ſhe may pleaſe her ſelfe a time in her conceit of braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; I ſhall aſſure her, ſhe ſhall haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in heart, no hope in death, no ioy in God, no boldneſſe in iudgement.

                     <p n="2">2. No ornament or attire muſt be worne againſt the iudgement and example of the modeſt, frugall, and graue perſons of our owne ranke. <hi>Philipp.</hi> 4.9. We muſt thinke and doe whatſoeuer things pertaine to <hi>good report,</hi> and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer things haue any <hi>vertue or praiſe in them.</hi> Now to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the moſt modeſt, ſober, and vertuous of our ranke, is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:5622:233"/>and of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: whereas to bee inuentors of euill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, or imitators of light, wanton, gariſh, or proud perſons, in their proud or fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall faſhions, brings a iuſt blot vpon the perſon, and a gaſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which will not eaſily be healed. And how iuſt is it, that ſuch as will pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and glory in themſelues, againſt the glory of Ieſus Chriſt, and the Goſpell of Chriſt which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5622:233"/>ſhould meet with ſhame and contempt amongſt men of ſound iudgement, and be ſent away with a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous flatterie only of ſuch wantons as themſelues?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. No ornament muſt be vſed which is not as well expedient as lawfull. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. <hi>All things</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) <hi>are lawfull for mee, but all things are not expedient.</hi> Euen ſuch things as are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, may be inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a meane eſtate
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5622:234"/>and condition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in degree, or in abilitie.</p>
                     <p>What an inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient exceſſe is it, to weare gold for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they want ſiluer for neceſſaries: now to weare iewels for pride, and then pawne them for need: to ruffle it in ſilkes, when they can ſcarce pay for cloth: to make an idle ſhew and oſtentation of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, when indeede they are in great wants? Is it fit for ſuch to follow faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5622:234"/>No, but as wee muſt eat according to that with which the Lord hath bleſſed vs; ſo muſt we alſo in our attire and habits. The Lord hath called ſuch perſons to frugalitie and thriftineſſe, and to ſuit their cloathes and ornaments to their preſent eſtate. Euen a ciuill wiſe man will fit his minde to his eſtate, if his eſtate bee not fitted to his minde.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, coſtly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments fit not euery degree that are able.

                     <p>Adde hereunto, that ſuch things as are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, may be inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient at ſome times.
